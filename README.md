# Boggle-game

In this problem, you will define a function, boggle_words(), that takes a board as input and returns a set of words that can be made from the board according to the rules of Boggle.

Ssearche for words that can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjacent cubes, where "adjacent" cubes are those horizontally, vertically, and diagonally neighboring. Words must be at least three letters long, may include singular and plural (or other derived forms) separately, but may not use the same letter cube more than once per word.
